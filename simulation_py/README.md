# simulation_py
You can choose to run different simulations, but we recommend trying the two main ones, one where you can try the autopilot controller with an airspeed, heading and altitude command as well as manual control of the aircraft, or one where the autopilot will follow a path provided.
## Controller
To run this simulation, run the _autopilot_fail-safe_ file located in the control folder. Should a PS4 controller be plugged in, you'll be able to control the aircraft and the autopilot switch with it. In this case, the left analog will control both the ailerons and the elevator, the right analog controls the rudder, the R2 button controls the throttle and the circle and triangle button, turn the autopilot off and on respectively. When the autopilot is on, the input to it can be defined in the window that will open along the simulation.
## Path following
To run this simulation, run the _path_following_simulation.py_ file located in the path_following folder. You can either follow a straight line path or an orbital path, and you can define the path to follow inside the _path_following_simulation.py_ file.
